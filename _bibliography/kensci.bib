  abstract={With the increased adoption of AI in healthcare, there is a growing recognition and demand to regulate AI in healthcare to avoid potential harm and unfair bias against vulnerable populations. Around a hundred governmental bodies and commissions as well as leaders in the tech sector have proposed principles to create responsible AI systems. However, most of these proposals are short on specifics which has led to charges of ethics washing. In this tutorial we offer a guide to help navigate through complex governmental regulations and explain the various constituent practical elements of a responsible AI system in healthcare in the light of proposed regulations. Additionally, we breakdown and emphasize that the recommendations from regulatory bodies like FDA or the EU are necessary but not sufficient elements of creating a responsible AI system. We elucidate how regulations and guidelines often focus on epistemic concerns to the detriment of practical concerns e.g., requirement for fairness without explicating what fairness constitutes for a use case. FDA's Software as a medical device document and EU's GDPR among other AI governance documents talk about the need for implementing sufficiently good machine learning practices. In this tutorial we elucidate what that would mean from a practical perspective for real world use cases in healthcare throughout the machine learning cycle i.e., Data Management, Data Specification, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Model Specification, Model Explainability, Model Fairness, Reproducibility, checks for data leakage and model leakage. We note that conceptualizing responsible AI as a process rather than an end goal accords well with how AI systems are used in practice. We also discuss how a domain centric stakeholder perspective translates into balancing requirements for multiple competing optimization criteria.},

  abstract={Prediction of diabetes and its various complications has been studied in a number of settings, but a comprehensive overview of problem setting for diabetes prediction and care management has not been addressed in the literature. In this document we seek to remedy this omission in literature with an encompassing overview of diabetes complication prediction as well as situating this problem in the context of real world healthcare management. We illustrate various problems encountered in real world clinical scenarios via our own experience with building and deploying such models. In this manuscript we illustrate a Machine Learning (ML) framework for addressing the problem of predicting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) together with a solution for risk stratification, intervention and management. These ML models align with how physicians think about disease management and mitigation, which comprises these four steps: Identify, Stratify, Engage, Measure.},

  abstract={Datasets from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are increasingly large and complex, creating challenges in their use for predictive modeling. The two major challenges are large-scale and high-dimensionality. One of the common way to address the large-scale challenge is through use of data phenotypes: clinically relevant characteristic groupings that can be expressed as logical queries (e.g., “senior patients with diabetes”). With the increasing use of machine learning across the continuum of care, phenotypes play an important role in modeling for population management, clinical trials, observational and interventional research, and quality measures. Yet, phenotype interpretation can often be difficult and require post-hoc clarifications from experienced clinicians. For example, detailed analysis may be needed to find that all patients in a a phenotype are diabetic seniors with complications from previous surgery. Moreover, the high-dimensionality problem is often addressed either separately or simultaneously with phenotyping by dimension reduction methods that may further hinder interpretability. In this paper, we introduce the notion of interpretable data phenotypes generated by an unsupervised learning technique. Methods are designed to disambiguate relative feature memberships, thus facilitating general clinical validation, and alleviating the problem of high-dimensionality. The empirical study applies the proposed unsupervised interpretable phenotyping method to a real world healthcare dataset (MIMIC), then uses hospital length of stay as a reference prediction task. The results demonstrate that the proposed method produces phenotypes with improved interpretability and without diminishing the quality of prediction results.},

  abstract={This paper surveys visual methods of explainability of Machine Learning (ML) with focus on moving from quasi-explanations that dominate in ML to domain-specific explanation supported by granular visuals. ML interpretation is fundamentally a human activity and visual methods are more readily interpretable. While efficient visual representations of high-dimensional data exist, the loss of interpretable information, occlusion, and clutter continue to be a challenge, which lead to quasi-explanations. We start with the motivation and the different definitions of explainability. The paper focuses on a clear distinction between quasi-explanations and domain specific explanations, and between explainable and an actually explained ML model that are critically important for the explainability domain. We discuss foundations of interpretability, overview visual interpretability and present several types of methods to visualize the ML models. Next, we present methods of visual discovery of ML models, with the focus on interpretable models, based on the recently introduced concept of General Line Coordinates (GLC). These methods take the critical step of creating visual explanations that are not merely quasi-explanations but are also domain specific visual explanations while these methods themselves are domain-agnostic. The paper includes results on theoretical limits to preserve n-D distances in lower dimensions, based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, point-to-point and point-to-graph GLC approaches, and real-world case studies. The paper also covers traditional visual methods for understanding ML models, which include deep learning and time series models. We show that many of these methods are quasi-explanations and need further enhancement to become domain specific explanations. We conclude with outlining open problems and current research frontiers.},

The fidelity of the explanations are dependent upon the algorithms used as well as on the fidelity of the data. Many real world datasets have missing values that can greatly influence explanation fidelity. The standard way to deal with such scenarios is imputation. This can, however, lead to situations where the imputed values may correspond to a setting which refer to counterfactuals. Acting on explanations from AI models with imputed values may lead to unsafe outcomes. In this paper, we explore different settings where AI models with imputation can be problematic and describe ways to address such scenarios.},

  abstract={—Machine Learning (ML) techniques now impact a wide variety of domains. Highly regulated industries such as healthcare and finance have stringent compliance and data governance policies around data sharing. Advances in secure multiparty computation (SMC) for privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) can help transform these regulated industries by allowing ML computations over encrypted data with personally identifiable information (PII). Yet very little of SMC-based PPML has been put into practice so far. In this paper we present the very first framework for privacypreserving classification of tree ensembles with application in healthcare. We first describe the underlying cryptographic protocols that enable a healthcare organization to send encrypted data securely to a ML scoring service and obtain encrypted class labels without the scoring service actually seeing that input in the clear. We then describe the deployment challenges we solved to integrate these protocols in a cloud based scalable risk-prediction platform with multiple ML models for healthcare AI. Included are system internals, and evaluations of our deployment for supporting physicians to drive better clinical outcomes in an accurate, scalable, and provably secure manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such applied framework with SMC-based privacypreserving machine learning for healthcare. },

In theory, such expenditures should be easily identifiable with large amounts of historical data. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no data mining framework that systematically addresses the problem of identifying unwarranted variation in expenditures on high dimensional claims data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. In this paper we propose methods to uncover unwarranted variation in healthcare spending by automatically extracting reference groups of peerproviders from the data and then detecting high cost outliers within these groups. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed framework on datasets from a large ACO in the United States to successfully identify unwarranted variation in therapeutic procedures even in low cost claims that had previously gone unnoticed.},

Clinical risk calculators provide information about a person’s chance of having a disease or encountering a clinical event. Such tools could be highly useful to educate patients to understand and monitor their health conditions. Unlike existing risk calculators that are primarily designed for domain experts, RiskO-Meter is useful to patients who are unfamiliar with medical terminologies, or providers who have limited information about a patient. Risk-O-Meter is designed in a way such that it is flexible enough to accept limited or incomplete data inputs, and still manages to predict the clinical risk efficiently and effectively. Current version of Risk-O-Meter evaluates 30-day risk of hospital readmission. However, the proposed system framework is applicable to general clinical risk predictions. In this demonstration paper, we describe different components of Risk-O-Meter and the intelligent algorithms associated with each of these components to evaluate risk of readmission using incomplete patient data inputs.}

  abstract={Improving cost transparency in healthcare creates opportunities to empower patients and reduce spending. Medical prices vary widely within U.S. markets but few consumers (i.e., patients) have the information to shop for their healthcare services. Consumers are starting to question why their healthcare bills are so high – and why they can’t find healthcare prices at all. In this work we apply predictive analytics to help consumers make educated decisions related to childbirth cost. Regression decision trees are used to represent the path from the patients’ characteristics (e.g. demographics, comorbidities), choices of medical procedures, and choices of care providers, to the predicted cost variations. The outcome of this research helps consumers make informed choices as well as reduce healthcare expenditures. We demonstrate a system for childbirth cost prediction that far outperforms our baseline model in terms of prediction error. Additionally, we identify several attributes, such as labor room usage, operating room services, anesthesia, and hospital cost to charge ratio, which play a significant role in determining the overall cost of childbirth.},

  abstract={The increasing availability of digital health records should ideally improve accountability in healthcare. In this context, the study of predictive modeling of healthcare costs forms a foundation for accountable care, at both population and individual patient-level care. In this research we use machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions of healthcare costs on publicly available claims and survey data. Specifically, we investigate the use of the regression trees, M5 model trees and random forest, to predict healthcare costs of individual patients given their prior medical (and cost) history. Overall, three observations showcase the utility of our research: (a) prior healthcare cost alone can be a good indicator for future healthcare cost, (b) M5 model tree technique led to very accurate future healthcare cost prediction, and (c) although state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms are also limited by skewed cost distributions in healthcare, for a large fraction (75%) of population, we were able to predict with higher accuracy using these algorithms. In particular, using M5 model trees we were able to accurately predict costs within less than $125 for 75% of the population when compared to prior techniques. Since models for predicting healthcare costs are often used to ascertain overall population health, our work is useful to evaluate future costs for large segments of disease populations with reasonably low error as demonstrated in our results on real-world publicly available datasets.},

In addition to the gender and the age of the patient at the time of surgery, our models rely only on available results from blood tests done prior to the surgery.

  abstract={Mitigating risk-of-readmission of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients within 30 days of discharge is important because such readmissions are not only expensive but also critical indicator of provider care and quality of treatment. Accurately predicting the risk-of-readmission may allow hospitals to identify high-risk patients and eventually improve quality of care by identifying factors that contribute to such readmissions in many scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the problem of predicting risk-of-readmission as a supervised learning problem, using a multi-layer classification approach. Earlier contributions inadequately attempted to assess a risk value for 30 day readmission by building a direct predictive model as opposed to our approach. We first split the problem into various stages, (a) at risk in general (b) risk within 60 days (c) risk within 30 days, and then build suitable classifiers for each stage, thereby increasing the ability to accurately predict the risk using multiple layers of decision. The advantage of our approach is that we can use different classification models for the subtasks that are more suited for the respective problems. Moreover, each of the subtasks can be solved using different features and training data leading to a highly confident diagnosis or risk compared to a one-shot single layer approach. An experimental evaluation on actual hospital patient record data from Multicare Health Systems shows that our model is significantly better at predicting risk-of-readmission of CHF patients within 30 days after discharge compared to prior attempts.},

  abstract={Developing holistic predictive modeling solutions for risk prediction is extremely challenging in healthcare informatics. Risk prediction involves integration of clinical factors with socio-demographic factors, health conditions, disease parameters, hospital care quality parameters, and a variety of variables specific to each health care provider making the task increasingly complex. Unsurprisingly, many of such factors need to be extracted independently from different sources, and integrated back to improve the quality of predictive modeling. Such sources are typically voluminous, diverse, and vary significantly over the time. Therefore, distributed and parallel computing tools collectively termed big data have to be developed. In this work, we study big data driven solutions to predict the 30-day risk of readmission for congestive heart failure (CHF) incidents. First, we extract useful factors from National Inpatient Dataset (NIS) and augment it with our patient dataset from Multicare Health System (MHS). Then, we develop scalable data mining models to predict risk of readmission using the integrated dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the open-source predictive modeling framework we used, describe the results from various modeling algorithms we tested, and compare the performance against baseline non-distributed, non-parallel, non-integrated small data results previously published to demonstrate comparable accuracy over millions of records.}

In this paper, we propose a framework Divide-n-Discover to visualize and explore clinical data effectively, and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting readmission risk for Congestive Heart Failure patients. Our proposed method provides clinicians a mechanism to dynamically explore the data and to understand how a single factor may influence the risk of readmission for a given patient. For example, our study indicates that patients between age 47 and 48 have 2.63 time higher chance of getting readmitted to the hospital within 30 days, compared to other patients; likewise, patients with length of stay above 1 ays are 2.27 times more likely to be readmitted within 30 days. The finding suggests that hospitals might be under pressure to discharge patients within two week while some patients may benefit from a longer stay. These observations may become valid hypotheses leading to further clinical investigation or discoveries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever work that proposes principled discretization and visualization techniques in the hospital readmission risk prediction problem.}

Central to these abilities is the need for fast ad-hoc query processing of large volumes of complex healthcare datasets. End users who work with healthcare databases spend enormous effort in data exploration since exploration is the first step to any subsequent predictive modeling to generate actionable insights for patients, providers and physicians. Unfortunately, unlike other domains the complexity and volumes of claims (ICD9 or 10) as well as clinical (HL7) healthcare datasets results in data exploration solutions being extremely slow and cumbersome when attempted using traditional disk resident data warehousing approaches. In this paper we describe the first ever attempt of real-time data exploration for healthcare datasets using in-memory databases. We benchmark and compare two such in-memory database systems to study responsiveness and ability to handle complexity of typical health data exploration tasks. We share our work in progress results and outline key issues that need to be addressed for forthcoming advances in this very important big data vertical.}

  abstract={Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a serious chronic condition often leading to 50% mortality within 5 years. Improper treatment and post-discharge care of CHF patients leads to repeat frequent hospitalizations (i.e., readmissions). Accurately predicting patient's risk-of-readmission enables care-providers to plan resources, perform factor analysis, and improve patient quality of life. In this paper, we describe a supervised learning framework, Dynamic Hierarchical Classification (DHC) for patient's risk-of-readmission prediction. Learning the hierarchy of classifiers is often the most challenging component of such classification schemes. The novelty of our approach is to algorithmically generate various layers and combine them to predict overall 30-day risk-of-readmission. While the components of DHC are generic, in this work, we focus on congestive heart failure (CHF), a pressing chronic condition. Since healthcare data is diverse and rich and each source and feature-subset provides different insights into a complex problem, our DHC based prediction approach intelligently leverages each source and feature-subset to optimize different objectives (such as, Recall or AUC) for CHF risk-of-readmission. DHC's algorithmic layering capability is trained and tested over two real world datasets and is currently integrated into the clinical decision support tools at MultiCare Health System (MHS), a major provider of healthcare services in the northwestern US. It is integrated into a QlikView App (with EMR integration planned for Q2) and currently scores patients everyday, helping to mitigate readmissions and improve quality of care, leading to healthier outcomes and cost savings.}

  abstract={The hospital readmission rate of patients within 30 days after discharge is broadly accepted as a healthcare quality measure and cost driver in the United States. The ability to estimate hospitalization costs alongside 30 day risk-stratification for such readmissions provides additional benefit for accountable care, now a global issue and foundation for the U.S.~government mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Recent data mining efforts either predict healthcare costs or risk of hospital readmission, but not both. In this paper we present a dual predictive modeling effort that utilizes healthcare data to predict the risk and cost of any hospital readmission (``all-cause''). For this purpose, we explore machine learning algorithms to do accurate predictions of healthcare costs and risk of 30-day readmission.Results on risk prediction for ``all-cause'' readmission compared to the standardized readmission tool (LACE) are promising, and the proposed techniques for cost prediction consistently outperform baseline models and demonstrate substantially lower mean absolute error (MAE).}

  abstract={A large percentage of emergency department (ED) visits originates from a small percentage of patients who keep returning to the ED. Being able to flag these frequent users in advance can help clinicians to take appropriate interventions to reduce the number of ED visits, thereby reducing cost and improving quality of care. In this paper we present machine learning models that can predict future ED utilization of individual patients, using only information from the present and the past. We train decision trees (DT), boosted decision trees (AdaBoost) and logistic regression (LR) models on discharge records from California-licensed hospitals from the years 2009 and 2010, and evaluate their predictive accuracy for the years 2011-2013. We also study the impact of including di↵erent groups of demographic, frequency of ED visits, distance to emergency department, and clinical features on the accuracy of our predictive models. Overall there are three key findings of this study. First, all three techniques (LR, DT and AdaBoost) have a strong predictive ability to discriminate frequent ED users (number of visits 5). Second, our models show consistent outcomes across all three test years in our dataset, which is a desired property when a predictive tool that is stable and consistent year over year is required. Third, least and most frequent ED users are comparatively easier to predict when compared to moderate ED users (with higher sensitivity and AUC scores).},

We present a comparative performance analysis of decision trees, boosted decision trees and logistic regression models that can flag, at the time of discharge, patients with an anticipated early, lengthy and expensive readmission. We validate our models using discharge records of 500K congestive heart failure patients from California-licensed hospitals.}

The debates include a statement that This tutorial covers the state-of-the-art research, development, and applications in the area of Interpretable Knowledge Discovery and ML boosted by Visual Methods. The topic is interdisciplinary, bridging efforts of research and applied communities in AI, Machine Learning, Visual Analytics, Information Visualization, and HCI. This is a novel and fast-growing area with significant applications, and potential due to its importance in applications and prominence of visual ways of human cognition and perception. The recent progress in this area is very evident with a major deep learning explanation approach, based on visualization of salient areas and methods to visualize similarity of high-dimensional data in deep learning and other ML studies.  Multiple techniques are emerging including lossless and reversible methods to visualize high-dimensional data, which will be presented in this tutorial to stimulate studies beyond heatmaps, t-SNE, and black-box ML models in general.},

  abstract={Interpretable machine learning (ML) refers to machine learning models that can provide reasons or explanations for why certain patient-level predictions are made. In high-stakes domains outside of healthcare, merely providing traditional ML metrics like accuracy, precision, recall etc. are not sufficient. In healthcare, explanations for model results and patient-level risk predictions is imperative. Clinical providers and other decision makers note interpretability as a priority for implementation and use since black box machine learning models seldom engender trust. Decisions based on machine learning predictions could inform diagnoses, clinical care pathways, and patient risk stratification, among many others. It follows, that for decisions of such import, clinicians and other staff desire to know the “reasons” behind the prediction. This workshop will cover the definitions, nuances, challenges, and requirements for the design of interpretable and explainable ML models and systems in healthcare with an emphasis on the clinical application of this framework. We will discuss many uses in which interpretable machine learning models are needed in healthcare. Additionally, we explore the landscape of recent advances to address the challenges of model interpretability in healthcare and also broadly describe how to select the most appropriate interpretable ML algorithm for a given problem, given certain clinically-oriented constraints. We will engage our audience by having interactive quizzes throughout the tutorial. Based on the practice domains of our audience, we will also encourage participants to share their stories and learnings from applying ML in healthcare and how interpretability / explainability may have played a role. If the size of our audience is appropriate, we may also break the audience into groups to discuss the desiderata of explainable ML, its advantages, and potential pitfalls. We will also share additional resources and bibliography with the participants at the conclusion of the session for further learning.},

  abstract={As AI and machine learning are being increasingly integrated into healthcare, challenges regarding creating responsible AI systems that are interpretable, fair, transparent, unbiased, robust and reliable are coming under increasing scrutiny. In this talk I will focus on one important aspect of such systems – Explainability, explore what constitutes explainable AI in healthcare and what are the nuances, challenges, and requirements for the design of explainable AI in healthcare. Drawing on insights from the academia and experience from industry the talk will delve into why is explainability in healthcare different from other domains and how deployed systems may have counterintuitive implications e.g., explainability leading to distrust, explainable systems leading to more opaque models etc. The talk will focus on the application of explainability techniques and the practical challenges in creating effective explainable AI models in healthcare. Finally, the talk will describe open problems and research directions for the AI in healthcare community.},
