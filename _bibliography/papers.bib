  abstract={With the increased adoption of AI in healthcare, there is a growing recognition and demand to regulate AI in healthcare to avoid potential harm and unfair bias against vulnerable populations. Around a hundred governmental bodies and commissions as well as leaders in the tech sector have proposed principles to create responsible AI systems. However, most of these proposals are short on specifics which has led to charges of ethics washing. In this tutorial we offer a guide to help navigate through complex governmental regulations and explain the various constituent practical elements of a responsible AI system in healthcare in the light of proposed regulations. Additionally, we breakdown and emphasize that the recommendations from regulatory bodies like FDA or the EU are necessary but not sufficient elements of creating a responsible AI system. We elucidate how regulations and guidelines often focus on epistemic concerns to the detriment of practical concerns e.g., requirement for fairness without explicating what fairness constitutes for a use case. FDA's Software as a medical device document and EU's GDPR among other AI governance documents talk about the need for implementing sufficiently good machine learning practices. In this tutorial we elucidate what that would mean from a practical perspective for real world use cases in healthcare throughout the machine learning cycle i.e., Data Management, Data Specification, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation, Model Specification, Model Explainability, Model Fairness, Reproducibility, checks for data leakage and model leakage. We note that conceptualizing responsible AI as a process rather than an end goal accords well with how AI systems are used in practice. We also discuss how a domain centric stakeholder perspective translates into balancing requirements for multiple competing optimization criteria.},

  abstract={Prediction of diabetes and its various complications has been studied in a number of settings, but a comprehensive overview of problem setting for diabetes prediction and care management has not been addressed in the literature. In this document we seek to remedy this omission in literature with an encompassing overview of diabetes complication prediction as well as situating this problem in the context of real world healthcare management. We illustrate various problems encountered in real world clinical scenarios via our own experience with building and deploying such models. In this manuscript we illustrate a Machine Learning (ML) framework for addressing the problem of predicting Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) together with a solution for risk stratification, intervention and management. These ML models align with how physicians think about disease management and mitigation, which comprises these four steps: Identify, Stratify, Engage, Measure.}

  abstract={Over the past several years, across the globe, there has been an increase in people seeking care in emergency departments (EDs). ED resources, including nurse staffing, are strained by such increases in patient volume. Accurate forecasting of incoming patient volume in emergency departments (ED) is crucial for efficient utilization and allocation of ED resources. Working with a suburban ED in the Pacific Northwest, we developed a tool powered by machine learning models, to forecast ED arrivals and ED patient volume to assist end-users, such as ED nurses, in resource allocation. In this paper, we discuss the results from our predictive models, the challenges, and the learnings from users' experiences with the tool in active clinical deployment in a real world setting.}

While the need for accountability of AI models is near ubiquitous, healthcare in particular is a challenging field where accountability of such systems takes upon additional importance, as decisions in healthcare can have life altering consequences. In this paper we present preliminary results on fairness in the context of classification parity in healthcare. We also present some exploratory methods to improve fairness and choosing appropriate classification algorithms in the context of healthcare.}

  abstract={This paper surveys visual methods of explainability of Machine Learning (ML) with focus on moving from quasi-explanations that dominate in ML to domain-specific explanation supported by granular visuals. ML interpretation is fundamentally a human activity and visual methods are more readily interpretable. While efficient visual representations of high-dimensional data exist, the loss of interpretable information, occlusion, and clutter continue to be a challenge, which lead to quasi-explanations. We start with the motivation and the different definitions of explainability. The paper focuses on a clear distinction between quasi-explanations and domain specific explanations, and between explainable and an actually explained ML model that are critically important for the explainability domain. We discuss foundations of interpretability, overview visual interpretability and present several types of methods to visualize the ML models. Next, we present methods of visual discovery of ML models, with the focus on interpretable models, based on the recently introduced concept of General Line Coordinates (GLC). These methods take the critical step of creating visual explanations that are not merely quasi-explanations but are also domain specific visual explanations while these methods themselves are domain-agnostic. The paper includes results on theoretical limits to preserve n-D distances in lower dimensions, based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, point-to-point and point-to-graph GLC approaches, and real-world case studies. The paper also covers traditional visual methods for understanding ML models, which include deep learning and time series models. We show that many of these methods are quasi-explanations and need further enhancement to become domain specific explanations. We conclude with outlining open problems and current research frontiers.}

  abstract={Explainable models in Artificial Intelligence are often employed to ensure transparency and accountability of AI systems. The fidelity of the explanations are dependent upon the algorithms used as well as on the fidelity of the data. Many real world datasets have missing values that can greatly influence explanation fidelity. The standard way to deal with such scenarios is imputation. This can, however, lead to situations where the imputed values may correspond to a setting which refer to counterfactuals. Acting on explanations from AI models with imputed values may lead to unsafe outcomes. In this paper, we explore different settings where AI models with imputation can be problematic and describe ways to address such scenarios.},

Optimising ED patient flow requires early identification of patients needing inpatient care to initiate the admissions process, improve bed management and reduce ED length of stay. Stratifying COPD patients by likelihood of admission and length of stay at triage would potentially facilitate these and other operational efficiencies, such as targeting early supported discharge team review and COPD care bundle. We propose a machine learning (ML) based approach to predicting the need for admission from ED amongst a cohort of COPD patients.},

  abstract={There are more than nine hundred Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the United States, both in the public and private sector, serving millions of patients across the country in a process to transition from fee-for-service to a value-based-care model for healthcare delivery in an effort to contain expenditures. Identifying fraud, waste, and abuse resulting in superfluous expenditures associated with care delivery is central to the success of ACOs and for making the cost of healthcare sustainable. In theory, such expenditures should be easily identifiable with large amounts of historical data. However, to the best of our knowledge there is no data mining framework that systematically addresses the problem of identifying unwarranted variation in expenditures on high dimensional claims data using unsupervised machine learning techniques. In this paper we propose methods to uncover unwarranted variation in healthcare spending by automatically extracting reference groups of peerproviders from the data and then detecting high cost outliers within these groups. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed framework on datasets from a large ACO in the United States to successfully identify unwarranted variation in therapeutic procedures even in low cost claims that had previously gone unnoticed.},

  abstract={The last decade has been characterized by an explosion of social media in a variety of forms. Since the data is captured in digital form it has become possible for the first time study human behavior at a massive scale. Not only is it possible to address traditional questions in the social sciences regarding collective dynamics of human behaviors but it is also possible to study new types of human behaviors which have arisen as a result of usage of new mediums like twitter, YouTube, Facebook, one games etc. Each of these mediums has its respective limitations and affordances. Out of all these mediums the most complex and data rich medium is that of Massive Online Games (MOGs). MOGs refer to massive online persistent environments (World of Warcraft, EVE Online, EverQuest etc) shared by millions of people . In general these environments are characterized by a rich array of activities and social interactions with a wide array of behaviors e.g., cooperation, trade, quest, deceit, mentoring etc. Such environments allow one to study human behavior at a level of granularity where it was not possible to do so previously. Given the challenges associated with analyzing this type of data traditional techniques in data mining and social network analysis have to be extended with insights from the social sciences. The tutorial will cover predictive and generative models in the study of MOGs. Additionally we will cover some SNA techniques which are more appropriate for MOGs given the multi-dimensionality of the data (P*/ERGM Models, IR Based Network Analysis, Hypergrah based Techniques, Coextensive Social Networks etc). We also describe the various ways in which MOGs exhibit similarities to the real world e.g., economic behaviors, clandestine behaviors, mentoring etc).},

  abstract={We identify robust features of trust in social networks; these are features which are discriminating yet uncorrelated and can potentially be used to predict trust formation between agents in other social networks. The features we investigate are based on an agent’s individual properties as well as those based on the agent’s location within the network. In addition, we analyze features which take into account the agent’s participation in other social interactions within the same network. Three datasets were used in our study—Sony Online Entertainment’s EverQuest II game dataset, a large email network with sentiments and the publicly available Epinions dataset. The first dataset captures activities from a complex persistent game environment characterized by several types of in-game social interactions, whereas the second dataset has anonymized information about people’s email and instant messaging communication. We formulate the problem as one of the link predictions, intranetwork and internetwork, in social networks. We first build machine learning models and then perform an ablation study to identify robust features of trust. Results indicate that shared skills and interests between two agents, their level of activity and level of expertise are the top three predictors of trust in a social network. Furthermore, if only network topology information were available, then an agent’s propensity to connect or communicate, the cosine similarity between two agents and shortest distance between them are found to be the top three predictors of trust. In our study, we have identified the generic characteristics of the networks used as well as the features investigated so that they can be used as guidelines for studying the problem of predicting trust formation in other social networks.},

If during a first time period, the device is not in continuous periodic communication with the repeater, the device automatically reverts to operation under the normal operating instructions. At the end of the first time period, the caregiver or the patient may decide to revert to the normal programming. During a second time period, the device operates according to the temporary programming unless the caregiver or the patient instructs the device to revert to the normal programming, or the device fails to receive a periodic continuation signal from the repeater. Adverse health affects to the patient may also trigger the device to revert to the normal programming during either the first or second time period.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of online communities, the deployment of knowledge, skills, experiences and user generated content are generally facilitated among participant users. In online social media-sharing communities, the success of social interactions for content sharing and dissemination among completely unknown users depends on ‘trust’. Therefore, providing a satisfactory trust model to evaluate the quality of content and to recommend personalized trustworthy content providers is vital for a successful online social media-sharing community. Current research on trust prediction strongly relies on a web of trust, which is directly collected from users. However, the web of trust is not always available in online communities and, even when it is available, it is often too sparse to accurately predict the trust value between two unacquainted people. Moreover, most of the extant trust research studies have not paid attention to the importance of distrust, even though distrust is a distinct concept from trust with different impacts on behavior. In this paper, we adopt the concepts of ‘trust’, ‘distrust’, and ‘lack of confidence’ in social relationships and propose a novel unifying framework to predict trust and distrust as well as to distinguish the confidently-made decisions (trust or distrust) from lack of confidence without a web of trust. This approach uses interaction histories among users including rating data that is available and much denser than explicit trust/distrust statements (i.e. a web of trust).},

  abstract={The problem of gold farmer detection is the problem of detecting players with illicit behaviors in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) and has been studied extensively. Detecting gold farmers or other deviant actors in social systems is traditionally understood as a binary classification problem, but the issue of false negatives is significant for administrators as residual actors can serve as the backbone for subsequent clandestine organizing. In this paper we address this gap in the literature by addressing the problem of false negative estimation for gold farmers in MMOs by employing the capture-recapture technique for false negative estimation and combine it with graph clustering techniques to determine 'hidden' gold farmers in social networks of farmers and normal players. This paper redefines the problem of gold farming as a false negative estimation problem and estimates the gold farmers in co-extensive MMO networks, previously undetected by the game administrators. It also identifies these undetected gold farmers using graph partitioning techniques and applies network data to address rare class classification problem. The experiments in this research found 53% gold farmers who were previously undetected by the game administrators.},

  abstract={Trust is a ubiquitous phenomenon in human societies. Computational trust refers to the mediation of trust via a computational infrastructure. It has been studied in a variety of contexts e.g., peer-to-peer systems, multi-agent systems, recommendation systems etc. While this is an active area of research, the types of questions that have been explored in this field has been limited mainly because of limitations in the types of datasets which are available to researchers. In this thesis questions related to trust in complex social environments represented by Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) are explored. The main emphasis is that trust is a multi-level phenomenon both in terms of how it operates at multiple levels of network granularities and how trust relates to other social phenomenon like homophily, expertise, mentoring, clandestine behaviors etc. Social contexts and social environments affect not just the qualitative aspects of trust but this phenomenon is also manifested with respect to the network and structural signatures of trust network Additionally trust is also explored in the context of predictive tasks: Previously described prediction tasks like link prediction are studied in the context of trust within the context of the link prediction family of problems: Link formation, link breakage, change in links etc. Additionally we define and explore new trust-related prediction problems i.e., trust propensity prediction, trust prediction across networks which can be generalized to the inter-network link prediction problem and success prediction based on using network measures of a person’s social capital as a proxy.},

In this paper we study the problem of trust in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) with respect to homophily and expertise. We prose a topology of homophily in MMOs based on the literature on homophily and domain knowledge of MMOs. Our results show that while there is some mapping between homophily in MMOs and the theories of homophily in the offline world, the mapping is not complete. Only ascribed homophily and value homophily is observed in the trust network, while other types of homophilies are conspicuously absent. We observed that the trust network exhibits many properties which are not observed in most other social networks. Based on our observations we propose a generative model for trust networks in MMOs.},

In recent years a number of models of group formation have been proposed. One such model is Johnson et al's [10] model of group evolution. The model is motivated by commonalities observed in evolution of street gangs in Los Angeles and guilds in an MMOG (World of Warcraft). In this paper we first apply their model to guilds in another MMOG (EQ2)1 and found results inconsistent from the model's predictions, additionally we found support for the role of homophily in guild formation, which was ruled out in previous results, Alternatively, we explore alternative models for guild formation and evolution in MMOGs by modifying earlier models to account for the existence of previous relationships between people.},

We explore features based on the node's individual properties as well as based on the node's location within the network. In addition, we take into account the node's participation in other social networks within a specific prediction task. Different machine learning models built on the features are evaluated with the goal of finding a common set of features which are both robust and discriminating across the two datasets. Shortest Distance and Sum of Degree are found to be robust, discriminating features across the two datasets. Finally, based on experiment results and observations, we provide insights into the underlying online social processes. These insights can be extended to models for online social trust.},

Game experts were also characterized by focusing their game time on completing tasks. Younger players showed a slim advantage over older players.

Prior work has examined trade relationships formed by gold farmers but not the trust relationships which exist between members of these organizations. We adopt a hypergraph approach to model the multi-modal relationships of gold farmers granting other players permission to use and modify objects they own. We argue these permissions reflect underlying trust relationships which can be analyzed using network analysis methods. We compare farmers’ trust networks to the trust networks of both unidentified farmers and typical players. Our results demonstrate that gold farmers’ networks are different from trust networks of normal players whereby farmers trust highly-central non-farmer players but not each other. These findings have implications for augmenting detection}

If individuals in online worlds operate under similar social and psychological motivations and constraints as the offline world, online behavioral data could inform theories about offline behavior. We examine high risk trading relationships in a MMOG to illuminate the structures online clandestine organizations employ to balance security with efficiency and compare this to an offline drug trafficking network. This data offers the possibility of performing social research on a scale that would be unethical or impracticable to do in the offline world. However, analyzing and generalizing from clandestine behavior in online settings raises complex epistemological and methodological questions about the validity of such mappings and what methods and metrics are appropriate in these contexts. We conclude by discussing how computational social science can be applied to online and offline criminological concerns and highlight the "dual use" implications of these technologies.}

In  this paper we address this problem in the context of coex- tensive social networks i.e., multiple social networks with  overlapping membership and evolving in time. We use data from Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) for our  experiments. We get the surprising results that adversar- ial networks are most effective in the recommendation task  and the trust networks are not as effective in prediction as  compared to other networks.

We use insights from theories of evolution of social communication networks and the MTML framework to derive models which can be used to make link predictions across networks.

Given the lack of standard metrics for Generalized Exchange, we propose a metric to quantify generalized exchange. We observe that the phenomenon of exchange can be used to differentiate networks. A key finding is that the manner in which the network is operationalized i.e., as cumulative network vs. active networks affects the measurement of exchange. Lastly we propose generative mechanisms for exchange in trust networks.}

  abstract={This paper examines online player performance in EverQuest II, a popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Sony Online Entertainment. The study uses the game’s player performance data to devise performance metrics for online players. We report three major findings. First, we show that the game’s point-scaling system overestimates performances of lower level players and underestimates performances of higher level players. We present a novel pointscaling system based on the game’s player performance data that addresses the underestimation and overestimation problems. Second, we present a highly accurate predictive model for player performance as a function of past behavior. Third, we show that playing in groups impacts individual performance and that player-level characteristics alone are insufficient in explaining an individual’s performance, which calls for a different set of performance metrics methods.}

  abstract={We examine the social behaviors of game experts in Everquest II, a popular massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMO). We rely on Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to examine the anonymous privacy-protected social networks of 1,457 players over a five-day period. We find that those who achieve the most in the game send and receive more communication, while those who perform the most efficiently at the game show no difference in communication behavior from other players. Both achievement and performance experts tend to communicate with those at similar expertise levels, and higherlevel experts are more likely to receive communication from other players. },

Although around one million gold farmers engage in gold farming related activities [18], to date a systematic study of identifying gold farmers has not been done. In this paper we use data from the Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMO) EverQuest II to identify gold farmers. We pose this as a binary classification problem and identify a set of features for classification purpose. Given the cost associated with investigating gold farmers, we also give criteria for evaluating gold farming detection techniques, and provide suggestions for future testing and evaluation techniques.},

  abstract={In a social network there may be people who are experts on a subject. Identifying such people and routing queries to such experts is an important prob￾lem. While the degree of separation between any node and an expert node may be small, assuming that social networks are small world networks, not all nodes may be willing to route the query because flooding the network with queries may result in the nodes becoming less likely to route queries in the future. Given this constraint and that there may be time constraints it is imperative to have an efficient way to identify experts in a network and route queries to these experts. In this paper we present an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based approach for expert identifica￾tion and query routing in social networks. Also, even after one has identified the experts in the network, there may be new emerging topics for which there are not identifiable experts in the network. For such cases we extend the basic ACO model and introduce the notion of composibility of pheromones, where trails of different pheromones can be combined to for routing purposes}

  abstract={Automatically detecting novel events in video data streams is an extremely challenging task. In recent years, machine-based parametric learning systems have been quite successful in exhaustively capturing novelty in video if the novelty filters are well-defined in constrained environments. Some important questions however remain: How close are such systems to human perception? Can results derived from comparing human perception with machine novelty help tasks such as storing (indexing) and retrieval of novel events in large video repositories? In this chapter a quantitative experimental evaluation of human-based vs. machine-based novelty systems is canvassed. A machine-based system for detecting novel events in video data streams is first described. The issues of designing an indexing-strategy or “Manga” (comic-book representation is termed as “manga” in Japanese) to effectively determine the “most-representative” novel frames for a video sequence are then discussed. The evaluation of human-based vs. machine-based novelty is quantified by metrics based on location of novel events, number of novel events, etc. Low-level image features were used for machine-based novelty detection and do not include any semantic processing such as object detection to keep the computational load to a minimum.}

  abstract={Internet based online social networks collectively facilitate the spread of ideas. Hence, to understand how social networks evolve as a function of time, it is critical to learn the relationship between the information dissemination pathways or flows and the type of ideas being disseminated. We first classify the spread of ideas into two types based on their rate and nature of proliferation; fads and non-fads. A ’fad’ refers to an idea that quickly becomes popular in a culture, remains popular for a brief period, and then loses popularity dramatically. We then model the information dissemination pathways for both these types of ideas. Our results indicate that the proliferation of information in a network strongly correlates with the the type of idea, the degree of participation of the nodes, and a node’s availability i.e., presence. Further we derived that after reaching a certain saturation point, a fad exhibits periodic spreading behavior implying that a fad rarely completely disappears from a network. We use data from an instant messaging network community to verify the proposed theoretical modeling framework.}

  abstract={Generating captions or annotations automatically for still images is a challenging task. Traditionally, techniques involving higher-level (semantic) object detection and complex feature extraction have been employed for scene understanding. On the basis of this understanding, corresponding text descriptions are generated for a given image. In this paper, we pose the auto-annotation problem as that of multi-relational association rule mining where the relations exist between image-based features, and textual annotations. The central idea is to combine low-level image features such as color, orientation, intensity, etc. and corresponding text annotations to generate association rules across multiple tables using multi-relational association mining. Subsequently, we use these association rules to auto-annotate test images. In this paper we also present a multi-relational extension to the FP-tree algorithm to accomplish the association rule mining task effectively. The motivation for using multi-relational association rule mining for multimedia data mining is to exhibit the potential accorded by multiple descriptions for the same image (such as multiple people labeling the same image differently). Moreover, multi-relational association rule mining can also benefit the auto-annotation process by pruning the number of trivial associations that are generated if text and image features were combined in a single table through a join.

  In this paper, we discuss these issues and the results of our auto-annotation experiments on different test sets. Another contribution of this paper is highlighting a need to develop robust evaluation metrics for the image annotation task. We propose several applicable scoring techniques and then evaluate the performance of the different algorithms to study the utility of these techniques. A detailed analysis of the datasets used and the performance results are presented to conclude the paper.}

  abstract={Small group research has been inadequate in systematically examining the direct and indirect effect of group input on group output and statistically defining the mediating effect of group process. To address this issue, a large dataset (N = 2,465) on grouping behavior was collected from an online game. Structural equation modeling was utilized to examine how group size and group competence diversity influences the group interaction process and group performance. The results suggest that group size has both direct and indirect effects on performance outcomes. Specific path analysis also shows that group size has a positive influence on the aggregation of group expertise, which has a positive effect on group performance. Group competence diversity and group size both have a negative effect on the frequency of group IM-based chat, which is in turn negatively related to group success in the online game environment. Theoretical and methodological implications of the findings for communication and small group research are discussed.}

  abstract={In this paper the classicist and the connectionist debate is integrated in a multimedia data mining framework. Due to the ready availability of visual information digitally, the problem to store, retrieve and organize images is gaining tremendous importance and poses a serious challenge for practitioners of AI and databases alike. The central problem for image database management is the idea of an annotation associated with every image. This idea of an annotation as a representation of an image is explored in this paper. The claim is that arriving at a suitable annotation using data mining techniques however does not solve the problem of representation and reference. Most image annotation techniques are classicist, while connectionist approaches which have the advantage of contextuality have not been explored much because of the problem of systematicity. Consequently the image annotation problem can be used as a critique of both.}
